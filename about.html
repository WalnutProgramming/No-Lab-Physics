      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>No Lab Physics is an interactive system for creating and sharing customizable, virtual physics labs. It was built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The code is open source and 
        <a href="https://github.com/WalnutProgramming/No-Lab-Physics">available on Github</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Through this project, we hope to make physics experimentation more accessible for students and educators, both in and out of the classroom.</p>
      <h2>Our Club</h2>
      <p>This app was made by students from the 
        <a href="http://walnuthillseagles.com/#gsc.tab=0">Walnut Hills High School</a> Programming Club, a chapter of 
        <a href="https://interalliance.org/">INTERalliance</a>. The club meets every Thursday to learn about programming and work on projects that we will present at competitions. The club is open to all Walnut Hills students interested in computers and IT, no matter their level of programming experience.
